# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Prediction Model App: 
1. This app machine learning model mainly used for flower sepal, petal with and length predict the features.
2. The Iris Flower Prediction App is a machine learning project that predicts the type of iris flower based on its physical measurements.
   
# ðŸ”‘ About the Dataset:
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 records of iris flowers with the following features:
1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)
   
# Each record belongs to one of three species:
1.Iris-setosa
2.Iris-versicolor
